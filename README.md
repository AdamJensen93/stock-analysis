# stock-analysis
## Overview
Our project was to find the total daily volume and annual return for each stock. The total daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout each day while the annual return is the percentage change in price from opening Jan 1st to Dec 31st. Knowing the annual return for each stock can help our client make a decision on what stocks to purchase for their clients and what stocks to avoid. We've fond the daily volume and annual return for each stock for the years 2017 and 2018
## Results
### After reviewing the anaysis, the first stock that stands out is TERP. TERP was the only stock to lose in 2017. Furthermore, there were a few stocks that performed to extreme levels. These stocks that stand out from the crowd with triple digit growth are DQ, ENPH, FSLR, and SEDG with DQ leading the way at 199.4%. DQ also stands out as it was only traded 35,796,200 times in a year where each stock that showed triple digit growth was traded significantly more. When compared to 2018, we see a different pattern. The only two stocks to show postitive returns were ENPH and RUN. Each other stock showed a dip. We also see a significant number of trades made on DQ compared to the year prior. The stock that stands out to me as a potential buy is ENPH. ENPH showed above average market returns in back to back years with larger number of daily transactions. This seems to be the stock on the list that can show consistent growth. DQ, FSLR, and SEDG may be valuable assets but I would avoid placing risk adverse clients with those stocks.
### Our refactoring process showed improvement, we were able to decrease the time the code ran by refactoring it. This will allow our client to reuse the code with more options and view more years of trade data in a more reasonable timeframe.
